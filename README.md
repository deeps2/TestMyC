# TestMyC
A simple quiz app which asks 6 questions on C language.

It's a very basic app as I built this when I started learning android. It asks 6 questions on C and displays the score in a toast.

The score will be displayed only when all questions are attempted. If you forgot to attend any question(s), 
then question number(s) of unattempted ones will be displayed in a toast message. Your progress will be preserved
if you change the orientation of device(potrait/landscape) while attempting quiz. The wrong ones will be highlighted
with Red color and you can reattempt them without reopening the app. Red Color will disappear once you answer
correctly in further attempts.
